# order-organizer
This is a little program i made to ease the mental charge while doing my job at a greengrocery. What it does is it takes a string with the elements in the order and sorts them in a way in which it's more useful for me to read it like that.

Inventory.xlsx file contains a list of each element, with a code attached to it. This is meant to work as a reference when it comes to sort the entire order by the elements's code.
